Samwaad App is a group project which our team that consists of 4 created, during our 3rd semester. It has both the front-end and back-end components connected to it.
I, being a front-end enthusiast contibuted on the front-end part, designing and layout of the website. 
In todayâ€™s situation, the real time chat app has become a key mode of communication as it has made people aware of the importance of networking and socializing over the web platforms.
Hence, we have come together to build a real time chatting web application to connect and talk with friends one on one as well as with room functionality. In this app, you can create your own room and share the room name and its credentials with your friends to have text-based communication.
